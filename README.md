<h1><strong><em>LOCKPASS, A PASSWORD MANAGER</em></strong></h1>
</center>

# **LockPass**
> *LockPass is a simple passsword manager made using [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) + [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) ([Nextron](https://github.com/saltyshiomix/nextron/)).*

## How it works
- Head over to the [Releases](https://github.com/BytesToBits/LockPass/releases) tab and download the latest version. The file you must downlaod must be formatted like so: `LockPass-Setup-[VERSION].exe`
- Run the downlaoded file. Chrome and Windows might try to prevent its download, but you can discard the alerts if you wish. There are no threats in the applications whatsoever.
- Whenever there is a new release, the application will update automatically.
- Passwords are saved __locally__, so there is no fear of having them leaked online.

## To-Do
- Improve the overall design
- Settings panel allowing more features to be used
- A more protective way of storing passwords (encryptions & user pin)
